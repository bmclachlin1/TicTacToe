# TicTacToe

TicTacToe game made with React.

I made this game as part of the tutorial on React's website https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html to introduce myself to the React JavaScript library.

I might try doing the 6 exercises they recommended at the end of the tutorial and styling the page to make it more of my own.
